 Most of the adventures in this book really happened. One or two were my own experiences.
The others were experiences of boys in my school. Huck Finn really
lived. Tom Sawyer is made of three real boys.
My book is for boys and girls, but I hope that men and women
also will read it. I hope that it will help them to remember pleasantly
the days when they were boys and girls, and how they felt and thought
and talked, what they believed, and what strange things they sometimes
did.
