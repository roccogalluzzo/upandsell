## Updandsell.me
Just another dead startup codebase. More important, this was my first Ruby on Rails application that rapresentend an important milestone in my career life.

This is what it looked like: https://web.archive.org/web/20160117033128/https://upandsell.me/

### Installation

I could've add few commands to install ruby, gems and run the server but I'm not going to waste your time. This app has alot of dead dependencies and won't start in modern systems without alot of work in upgrading them.
